## 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

Week one s challenge goal was to refactor an existing webpage to make it accessible and to improve SEO.

I did this by:
- adding semantic elements to the html
- making elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- adding alt attributes 
- organizing the heading elements so they fall in a sequential order
- adding a concise, descriptive title
- adding comments explaining changes made 
- consolidating CSS styl definitions where applicable
